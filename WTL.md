Abstract:
We present a mathematical analysis of a non-convex energy landscape for Robust Subspace Recovery. 
We prove that an underlying subspace is the only stationary point and local minimizer in a large neighborhood 
if a generic condition holds for a dataset. We further show that if the generic condition is satisfied, a geodesic 
gradient descent method over the Grassmannian manifold can exactly recover the underlying subspace with proper initialization. 
The condition is shown to hold with high probability for a certain model of data.
