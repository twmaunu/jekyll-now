Abstract:
This paper will serve as an introduction to the body of work on robust subspace recovery.
Robust subspace recovery involves finding an underlying low-dimensional subspace in a dataset 
that is possibly corrupted with outliers. While this problem is easy to state, it has been difficult 
to develop optimal algorithms due to its underlying nonconvexity. This work will emphasize advantages 
and disadvantages of proposed approaches and unsolved problems in the area.
