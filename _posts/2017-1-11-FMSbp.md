title: Fast, robust and non-convex subspace recovery
date: January 11, 2017

My first post will discuss the Fast Median Subspace algorithm. This algorithm is meant to be robust version of Principal Component Analysis for data where whole samples are corrupted. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/FMS">webpage</a> for more info, and see the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6145).
